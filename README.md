# Code-Quiz

## User Story
``
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers``

## Acceptance Criteria
``
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score``

## Description
 
This is challenge 4 of the bootcamp. I created a functional coding-quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for functionality. Within the HTML I created several divs with placeholders in headings and buttons, which I later generated on Javascript. Within the CSS, I stylized the page with color, flexboxes, and text. Within the Javascript, I was able to declare all my variables and create several functions and event listeners to make the quiz function. When a user opens the quiz, they are met with a set of instructions and a "start quiz" button. Once clicked, the user will see a timer begin to count down from 50 along with an array of questions. When the user selects an incorrect answer, they are met with a sound effect and 10 seconds removed from the time alloted. Once the last question is answered, user will see their final score and a textbox for them to input their initials. Once initials are inputted, users will click "view highscores" to see a log of all initials and scores.
